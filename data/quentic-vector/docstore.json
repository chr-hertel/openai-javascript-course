Before creating user accounts for the already people recorded in Quentic, you have to determine their access rights by creating authorization groups. These groups contain access rights. By doing so you determine which functions, module components, data records and documents are available to certain users in Quentic. Access: Administrator rights or editing rights Path: Administration | Authorization Groups Click New data record in the toolbar of the Authorization groups module component. Enter the group title inside the General tab. Navigate to the Access rights tab to determine the access rights and views (if applicable) for the users who will be added to this group. Click Add to add an access right. This will create a new entry in the list featuring a drop-down menu in the Component column. From this drop-down menu, select the module component that you want to assign access rights for. If the views and visibilities concept of Quentic is deactivated, proceed to step 7. If not, determine the view that the users of this authorization group will have for the selected component. Go to the row of the last created entry and click the column Business unit. A drop-down menu will appear where you can select the desired view. Determine the access rights that the users of this authorization group will have for the selected component (and, if applicable, the selected views). Go to the row of the new entry and click the column Access right. A drop-down menu will appear where you can select the desired access right. Click Save. Result: The authorization group appears in the data record list and is available for further use. In the next step, link users to authorization groups. The entire Administration module can only be accessed by users that are given administrator rights in the next step (Create users). However, authorization groups can be used to give users without administrator rights access to all subordinate module components except Settings. Under the Access rights tab you will find the headline Master data. The module components located there define the basic categories and classifications used within individual module components. For users without administrator rights the master data forms are not directly accessible through the navigation, but rather through jump labels within the module components. Normally the default inputs for master data forms are determined during Quentic set up and edited only if necessary. All module components not added to the Access rights tab will not be available to users in that authorization group, meaning these module components will not appear in these users’ navigation. Using the views and visibilities concept, you can create multiple entries for each individual module component within an authorization group, i.e. you can determine multiple rights simultaneously for different views. In this way both view-specific and data-record-specific access rights can be assigned. You can activate and deactivate the views and visibilities concept in the module Administration | Settings | General | Visibilities and access rights. A selection window can be used to add multiple access rights for different components at once. Click Select in the Access rights tab and select the check boxes for the forms that you want to add as entries. Decide which standard values to use for new links and then click Add.

Access: Administrator rights Path: Administration | Users Click New data record in the toolbar of the Users module component. Enter the username. The name must not contain spaces. Select the person who will receive the user account. The person’s email address will be entered automatically. Select a way for the user to create a password from the drop-down menu Set password. If you have selected Generate automatically (send by email), please proceed with step 7. Otherwise enter the password for this user account into the Password text box. Retype the password into the Retype password text box. If the user should not be able to change the password, select the User cannot change password check box. Then proceed with step 9. If this option is selected, the user will not be able to request a new password through the sign-in screen of Quentic. Select the Change password at next sign-in check box if the user should change their password after they sign in for the first time. For security reasons, this check box will always be automatically selected upon creating a new user account. Enter today’s date or the date from which the user account is to be used in the active since date field. Select the user license that is to be used for this account. Depending on which user licenses your company has acquired for Quentic, only certain options are available. To create a standard user (user without administration rights), keep the Standard user option button selected and proceed with step 12. If you want to create an administrator (user with administration rights), select the Administrator option button and then proceed with step 16. If a standard user should have the right to release documents, select the Document release check box. Determine the user access rights by clicking Link in the link box Authorization groups. This opens a new window. Select the check boxes for the authorization groups whose rights the user should receive. Click Add. Click Save. Result: The user appears in the data record list and is available for further steps. Depending on the settings chosen, an email with the current password may be sent to the person for whom the new user account was created. The user can now sign in to Quentic with their user name and password and will be able to use Quentic in accordance with their user license and assigned rights and authorization. It is advisable to enter an email address for each new user, so that a new password can be sent should the user forget their sign-in credentials and need to request a new password via the sign-in screen. It is possible that the email address of the new user has already been recorded in module Organization | Business Structure | People. In this case the email address for this person will already be filled in for the user account. If the email address is edited here, it will automatically be edited in the person data record in the module Organization | Business Structure | People. If you choose to set a password manually, please note that a password needs to meet certain requirements. These requirements are regulated in the module Administration | Settings | General | Security and can be displayed in the Users module component by hovering the cursor over the Password text box. The maximum amount of possible users in Quentic depends on the user licenses acquired by your company. An overview of the licenses available can be found in the the module Administration | Settings | General | License details. For the user license Named User the maximum amount of users is an absolute value. This means, for example, that with 10 purchased Named User licenses it is possible to create exactly 10 user accounts. These accounts may only be used by the users specified. The user license Full allows assigning any and all desired rights to a particular user account. The user license Read only allows for assigning reading rights. The options Administrator and Document release cannot be selected with this license. If an authorization group that includes editing and deleting rights is assigned to a Read user, these rights will be automatically transferred to reading rights. If a user is not assigned to an authorization group, they will only be able to access My Quentic and use the dashboard components available there, such as reporting an incident. To remove the link to an authorization group, select the respective entry’s check box and click Remove. To divide management of the various user groups between multiple company employees, select the desired business units in the Data record visibilities tab. This will limit access to this user data record for non-administrators for as long as the views and visibilities concept in the module Administration | Settings | General | Visibilities and access rights is active. To record a new selectable entry, click the respective jump label. To edit an existing entry, click its title. Enter/edit the desired data, save the data record and click the jump-back label.
